I am an <a href='https://ellis.eu/'>ELLIS</a> PhD student in the <a href='https://www.eml-unitue.de/'>EML Group</a> at the <a href='https://www.tum.de/en/'>Technical University of Munich</a> and <a href='https://www.helmholtz.ai/'>Helmholtz AI</a> under the supervision of <a href='https://www.eml-munich.de/people/zeynep-akata'>Zeynep Akata</a> and <a href='https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=FXNJRDoAAAAJ&hl=en'>Alexey Dosovitskiy</a> (<a href='https://inceptive.life/'>Inceptive</a>). As part of my ELLIS exachange, I had the pleasure to spend time at <a href='https://inceptive.life/'>Inceptive</a> working with among others Alexey and <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=mOG0bwsAAAAJ&hl=en/'>Jakob Uszkoreit</a>. I am broadly interested in generative modeling, representation learning, and optimal transport. My research is generously supported by the <a href='https://research.google/programs-and-events/phd-fellowship/recipients/'>Google PhD Fellowship 2025 in ML Foundations</a>.


Previously, I pursued a Bachelor in Informatics at <a href='https://www.lmu.de/en/'>LMU Munich</a> and a Master specializing in Machine Learning at <a href='https://www.tum.de/en/'>Technical University of Munich</a>, during which I was fortunate to partake in a number of research projects. I worked on early-stage Alzheimer's classification together with the <a href='http://www.klinikum.uni-muenchen.de/Klinik-und-Poliklinik-fuer-Nuklearmedizin/en/index.html'>LMU Department of Nuclear Medicine</a>, on Transfer Learning for audio classification under <a href='https://www.professoren.tum.de/guennemann-stephan'>Stephan Günnemann</a> which I continued as a working student at <a href='https://www.bmw.com/en/index.html'>BMW</a>, and completed my Master's thesis at <a href='https://www.helmholtz-munich.de/en'>Helmholtz Munich</a>, supervised by <a href='https://sites.google.com/view/nikikilbertus'>Niki Kilbertus</a> and <a href='https://www.helmholtz-munich.de/en/icb/pi/fabian-theis'>Fabian Theis</a>.
